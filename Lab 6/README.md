# Overview
In this lab, the developer is introduced to the Stepper Motor, specifically the 28BYJ-48 and the very common ULN2003 Motor Driver.

Tasks 1 and 2 are written in the sketches and require a rudimentary understanding of the internals of the stepper motor. Very simply, the stepper motor is comprised of 4 positive magnetic coils and 4 coils of the opposite polarity. These coils are magnetised sequentially and pull a rotor towards the magnetic coil. Sequentially magnetising and demagnetising the coils causes the rotor to be pulled from one coil to another resulting in the rotor spinning  

Task 3 is a software problem and introduces the developer to the Arduino libraries "Random" method.

# Extra
You may be finding the Arduino IDE bare and barren, especially if you are used to Intellisence which most IDEs now have. A solution to this is to install Visual Studio - or Visual Studio Code - open the extensions tab and install Visual Micro which is AWESOME! There is a paid version which improves compilation time and provides a few more cool features, but the free version is perfectly acceptable and includes intellisence. Try it out!
