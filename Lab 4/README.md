# Overview 
In this lab, the developer is introduced to concept of reading analogue signals using the Arduino's analogue pins. This is a skill which will be incredibly useful when utilising almost any type of sensor
The photoresistor is used in this lab with the task to read the values outputted by the photoresistor in an attempt to make a simple nightlight.
This project requires an LED, Photoresistor and a 10K Ohm Resistor.

# Tasks
The tasks for this lab are detailed in the solutions with the following additional task also detailed in the solution for task 2

The current program pauses the execution flow due to the 'delay' method. This can cause problems if multiple devices are connected to the Arduino
Find a method which will allow the execution flow to continue while keeping the same functionality. I.e. the LED will stay lit for 3 seconds.
